              We value thought-provoking, informative reviews that credit the
              technicality and themes of a piece as much as the actual content
              on-screen. We lean heavily toward in-depth recaps that detail the
              majority of plot points that occur, mostly for series we believe
              may be renewed or green-lit for another season. We write full
              season reviews for almost every show weâ€™ve covered on a weekly
              basis as a spoiler-free accompanying piece, acting as a more
              constructive, thoughtful and analytical review alongside our
              episodic snapshots.
